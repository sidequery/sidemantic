title: "Format Adapters"
---

Sidemantic can import and export semantic models from other popular semantic layer formats, letting you migrate between tools or use Sidemantic alongside existing definitions.

## Supported Formats

| Format | Import | Export | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Sidemantic** (native) | ✅ | ✅ | Full support |
| **Cube** | ✅ | ✅ | Core features |
| **MetricFlow** (dbt) | ✅ | ✅ | Core features |
| **LookML** (Looker) | ✅ | ✅ | Core features |
| **Hex** | ✅ | ✅ | Core features |

## Feature Compatibility

This table shows which Sidemantic features are preserved when importing/exporting to other formats:

| Feature | Cube | MetricFlow | LookML | Hex | Notes |
|---------|------|------------|--------|-----|-------|
| **Models** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Full bidirectional support |
| **Dimensions** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Full bidirectional support |
| **Time Dimensions** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | LookML: dimension_group; Hex: type variants |
| **Simple Metrics** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | sum, count, avg, etc. |
| **Ratio Metrics** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Hex: func_calc support |
| **Derived Metrics** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Hex: func_sql and func_calc |
| **Cumulative Metrics** | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Cube: rolling_window; others: limited |
| **Time Comparison** | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Exported as calculated measure |
| **Relationships** | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | Hex: explicit join_sql |
| **Segments** | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | Hex: via measure filters |
| **Metric Filters** | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | Hex: native filter support |
| **Parameters** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Not supported by target formats |
| **Hierarchies** | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Stored in meta or drill_members |
| **Inheritance** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Resolved before export (fully merged) |
| **Jinja Templates** | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | LookML: uses Liquid |
| **Metadata Fields** | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | format exported; others in meta |
| **Ungrouped Queries** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Sidemantic-specific, not exportable |

**Legend:**
- ✅ Full support - feature works bidirectionally
- ⚠️ Partial support - feature works with limitations
- ❌ Not supported - feature lost on export
- 🚧 Experimental - may have bugs or limitations

**Important Notes:**

- **Inheritance**: When exporting models or metrics with `extends`, the adapter automatically resolves the inheritance chain and exports the fully merged result. The parent model/metric and the `extends` field are not included in the export - only the complete, merged definition.
- **Segments & Hierarchies in MetricFlow**: Since MetricFlow doesn't have native support for these features, they're stored in the `meta` field. They're preserved on round-trip but won't be used by MetricFlow's query engine.
- **Metadata Fields**: Most metadata fields (format, drill_fields, etc.) are stored in `meta` fields for compatibility, but `format` is exported natively where supported.

## Using Adapters

adapter.export(layer.graph, "hex/models/")
```

## Migration Examples

### Cube → Sidemantic → MetricFlow

Migrate from Cube to MetricFlow via Sidemantic:

```python
from sidemantic.adapters.cube import CubeAdapter
from sidemantic.adapters.metricflow import MetricFlowAdapter

# Import from Cube
cube_adapter = CubeAdapter()
graph = cube_adapter.parse("cube/schema/")

# Export to MetricFlow
mf_adapter = MetricFlowAdapter()
mf_adapter.export(graph, "models/metrics/converted.yml")
```

### MetricFlow → Sidemantic (with enhancements)

Import MetricFlow and add Sidemantic-specific features:

```python
from sidemantic.adapters.metricflow import MetricFlowAdapter
from sidemantic import SemanticLayer, Segment

# Import from MetricFlow
adapter = MetricFlowAdapter()
graph = adapter.parse("models/metrics/")

# Add Sidemantic features
layer = SemanticLayer(graph=graph)

# Add segments (not in MetricFlow)
orders = layer.graph.get_model("orders")
orders.segments.extend([
    Segment(name="completed", sql="{model}.status = 'completed'"),
    Segment(name="high_value", sql="{model}.amount >= 500")
])

# Save enhanced model
layer.to_yaml("semantic_layer.yml")
```

## Format-Specific Notes

### Cube

**Strengths:**
- Simple, JavaScript-friendly syntax
- Good for basic aggregations and joins
- Strong SQL generation

**Limitations:**
- No native support for ratio or cumulative metrics
- Limited time comparison capabilities
- Relationships must use explicit join definitions

**Conversion Notes:**
- Cube `cubes` → Sidemantic `models`
- Cube `dimensions` → Sidemantic `dimensions`
- Cube `measures` → Sidemantic `metrics`
- Cube `joins` → Sidemantic `relationships` (inferred)

### MetricFlow (dbt)

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive metric type support
- Native time comparisons and cumulative metrics
- Entity-based relationship model
- Jinja template support

**Limitations:**
- dbt-specific configuration requirements
- More verbose YAML syntax
- Requires dbt context for some features

**Conversion Notes:**
- MetricFlow `semantic_models` → Sidemantic `models`
- MetricFlow `entities` → Inferred relationships
- MetricFlow `dimensions` → Sidemantic `dimensions`
- MetricFlow `measures` → Sidemantic `metrics` (model-level)
- MetricFlow `metrics` → Sidemantic `metrics` (graph-level)

### LookML (Looker)

**Strengths:**
- Simple, declarative syntax
- Strong support for time dimensions (dimension_group)
- Native segment (filter) support
- Widely adopted in industry

**Limitations:**
- Uses Liquid templates instead of Jinja
- Limited relationship inference (views don't declare joins)
- No native support for ratio or cumulative metrics
- Explore definitions needed for full join graph

**Conversion Notes:**
- LookML `views` → Sidemantic `models`
- LookML `dimensions` → Sidemantic `dimensions`
- LookML `dimension_group` → Multiple time dimensions
- LookML `measures` → Sidemantic `metrics`
- LookML `filters` (view-level) → Sidemantic `segments`
- LookML `derived_table` → Sidemantic model with SQL

### Hex

**Strengths:**
- Clean, straightforward YAML syntax
- Explicit join conditions with SQL interpolation
- Native support for both SQL and calculation formulas
- Strong measure filter support
- Good type system with specific timestamp variants

**Limitations:**
- Each YAML file is a single model (not as compact)
- No native segment support (use measure filters)
- Limited cumulative metric support
- Beta product with evolving format

**Conversion Notes:**
- Hex models (id, base_sql_table) → Sidemantic `models`
- Hex `dimensions` (expr_sql, expr_calc) → Sidemantic `dimensions`
- Hex `measures` (func, func_sql, func_calc) → Sidemantic `metrics`
- Hex `relations` (join_sql) → Sidemantic `relationships`
- Hex `filters` on measures → Sidemantic metric filters
- Hex `${interpolation}` → Kept as-is where possible

## Round-Trip Guarantees

### Lossless Round-Trips

These conversions preserve all information:

- **Sidemantic → Sidemantic**: Perfect round-trip (native format)

### Lossy Round-Trips

These conversions lose some information:

- **Sidemantic → Cube → Sidemantic**: Loses segments, cumulative metrics, time comparisons
- **Sidemantic → MetricFlow → Sidemantic**: Loses segments, ungrouped query support, hierarchies
- **Any format → Sidemantic**: May lose format-specific metadata

**Best Practice:** Keep your source of truth in one format and export to others as needed. Don't round-trip unless necessary.

## Validating Conversions

Always validate after import/export:

```python
# Import
graph = adapter.parse("source.yml")

# Verify models loaded
print(f"Loaded {len(graph.models)} models")
for name, model in graph.models.items():
    print(f"  {name}: {len(model.metrics)} metrics, {len(model.dimensions)} dimensions")

# Verify metrics
print(f"Loaded {len(graph.metrics)} graph-level metrics")

# Test query
layer = SemanticLayer(graph=graph)
sql = layer.compile(metrics=["orders.revenue"])
print("Generated SQL:", sql)

# Export and compare
adapter.export(graph, "output.yml")
graph2 = adapter.parse("output.yml")
assert len(graph.models) == len(graph2.models)
```

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues with format conversion:

1. Check the [compatibility table](#feature-compatibility) for known limitations
2. Validate your source format is correctly structured
3. Test with a simple model first before converting complex definitions
4. File an issue at [github.com/anthropics/sidemantic](https://github.com/anthropics/sidemantic/issues) with:
   - Source format and file
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Generated SQL or error messages
