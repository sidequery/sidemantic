Query the semantic layer with familiar SQL syntax.

## What This Is For

The SQL interface lets you query pre-defined metrics and dimensions using familiar SQL syntax. You can filter, sort, and combine data across models - the semantic layer handles joins and aggregations automatically.

**Good for:**
- Exploring metrics across dimensions (`SELECT revenue, status FROM orders WHERE region = 'US'`)
- Building dashboards and reports with consistent metric definitions
- Querying across related models without writing joins
- Using parameters for dynamic filters (`WHERE date >= {{ start_date }}`)

**Not for:**
- Ad-hoc analytics with `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, or other aggregation functions
- Complex SQL operations like subqueries, CTEs, or window functions
- One-off queries that don't fit your metric definitions

**If you need ad-hoc SQL:** Use `layer.compile()` to generate base SQL, then modify and execute it yourself.

## Basic Queries

```python
layer.sql("SELECT revenue FROM orders")

layer.sql("""
    SELECT revenue, status
    FROM orders
    WHERE status = 'completed'
""")
```

## Supported Features

### SELECT

Select measures and dimensions:

```sql
SELECT revenue, order_count, status
FROM orders
```

Table prefixes optional (inferred from FROM):

```sql
-- Both work
SELECT orders.revenue FROM orders
SELECT revenue FROM orders
```

### WHERE

Filter with standard SQL conditions:

```sql
SELECT revenue
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'completed'
  AND order_date >= '2024-01-01'
  AND amount > 100
```

### ORDER BY

```sql
SELECT revenue, status
FROM orders
ORDER BY revenue DESC, status ASC
```

### LIMIT / OFFSET

```sql
SELECT revenue FROM orders LIMIT 10

SELECT revenue FROM orders LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5
```

### Cross-Model Queries

Reference multiple models - joins happen automatically:

```sql
SELECT
    orders.revenue,
    customers.region,
    regions.country
FROM orders
```

### SELECT *

Expands to all dimensions and measures:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
-- Expands to all dimensions + measures in orders model
```

## Parameters

Use `{{ param }}` syntax:

```python
layer.sql(
    """
    SELECT revenue
    FROM orders
    WHERE order_date >= {{ start_date }}
      AND region = {{ region }}
    """,
    parameters={
        "start_date": "2024-01-01",
        "region": "US"
    }
)
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## Don't Quote Parameters
Parameters are automatically quoted based on type:
- ❌ `WHERE date >= '{{ start_date }}'` (creates `''2024-01-01''`)
- ✅ `WHERE date >= {{ start_date }}`
:::

## Limitations

These SQL features are **NOT supported**:

### No Explicit JOINs

❌ Can't write explicit JOIN syntax:
```sql
SELECT orders.revenue, customers.name
FROM orders
JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id
```
This will raise an error: `Explicit JOIN syntax is not supported`

✅ Instead, reference both models:
```sql
-- Joins happen automatically based on model relationships
SELECT orders.revenue, customers.name
FROM orders
```

### No GROUP BY

❌ Can't write:
```sql
SELECT status, SUM(amount)
FROM orders
GROUP BY status
```

✅ Instead:
```sql
-- Grouping is automatic based on dimensions
SELECT revenue, status
FROM orders
```

### No Aggregate Functions

❌ Can't write:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(amount)
FROM orders
```

✅ Instead, define measures:
```yaml
metrics:
  - name: order_count
    agg: count
  - name: revenue
    agg: sum
    sql: amount
```

Then:
```sql
SELECT order_count, revenue FROM orders
```

### No Subqueries

❌ Can't write:
```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT revenue FROM orders
) AS subquery
```

### No CTEs/WITH

❌ Can't write:
```sql
WITH temp AS (SELECT * FROM orders)
SELECT * FROM temp
```

### No HAVING

❌ Can't write:
```sql
SELECT status, revenue
FROM orders
HAVING revenue > 1000
```

✅ Use WHERE on measures instead:
```sql
SELECT status, revenue
FROM orders
WHERE revenue > 1000  -- This works!
```

### No Window Functions

❌ Can't write:
```sql
SELECT revenue, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY status)
FROM orders
```

✅ Use table calculations or cumulative measures instead.

### No DISTINCT

❌ Can't write:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT status FROM orders
```

✅ Just select the dimension:
```sql
SELECT status FROM orders
```

### No UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT

❌ Set operations not supported.

### No INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE

Read-only semantic layer.

## Why These Limitations?

The semantic layer rewrites your SQL to use pre-defined measures and handle joins automatically. This means:

1. **Measures must be pre-defined** - No ad-hoc `SUM()` in SELECT
2. **Joins are automatic** - Based on model relationships
3. **Grouping is automatic** - Based on dimensions selected

This trade-off ensures:
- ✅ Consistent metric definitions
- ✅ Automatic join handling
- ✅ Symmetric aggregate deduplication
- ✅ Centralized business logic

## Best Practices

::: {.callout-tip}
## Define Once, Query Anywhere
Define metrics in YAML:
```yaml
metrics:
  - name: revenue
    agg: sum
    sql: amount
```

Then query with simple SQL:
```sql
SELECT revenue FROM orders
```
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Complex Logic in Measures
Put complex logic in measure definitions, not queries:

```yaml
# Define complex measure
metrics:
  - name: high_value_revenue
    agg: sum
    sql: "CASE WHEN amount > 1000 THEN amount ELSE 0 END"
```

```sql
-- Simple query
SELECT high_value_revenue FROM orders
```
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## Filter on Joined Tables
Only filter on tables that are actually joined:

❌ This fails (customers not joined):
```sql
SELECT orders.revenue
WHERE customers.region = 'US'
```

✅ Include a dimension to force join:
```sql
SELECT orders.revenue, customers.region
WHERE customers.region = 'US'
```
:::

## Programmatic Alternative

For full flexibility, use the programmatic API:

```python
result = layer.query(
    metrics=["orders.revenue"],
    dimensions=["orders.status"],
    filters=["orders.status = 'completed'"],
    order_by=["orders.revenue DESC"],
    limit=10
)
```

Or generate SQL and execute yourself:

```python
sql = layer.compile(
    metrics=["orders.revenue"],
    dimensions=["orders.status"]
)

# Modify as needed
sql += " UNION SELECT ..."

# Execute directly
conn.execute(sql)
```
