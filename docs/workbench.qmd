The Sidemantic Workbench is an interactive terminal UI for exploring semantic layers, writing SQL queries, and visualizing results.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Launch with your models
sidemantic workbench ./models

# Try the demo
sidemantic workbench --demo

# Run without installing
uvx sidemantic workbench --demo
```

## Interface Overview

The workbench has three main sections:

### 1. Models Sidebar (Left)

Explore your semantic layer structure:

- **Models tree** - Browse all models in your semantic layer
- **Expandable nodes** - Click to view dimensions and metrics
- **Drag to resize** - Adjust sidebar width by dragging the right edge

The sidebar displays:
- Model names
- Dimensions (with types)
- Metrics (with aggregation types)
- Relationships

### 2. Query Editor (Top Right)

Write and manage SQL queries with multiple tabs:

**Query Tabs:**
- **Timeseries** - Revenue by month and region
- **Top Customers** - Customers ordered by revenue
- **Aggregates** - Metrics grouped by dimension
- **Custom** - Blank template for your own queries

Features:
- SQL syntax highlighting
- Line numbers
- Auto-indent
- SQL keyword completion

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- `Ctrl+R` - Run query
- `Ctrl+C` - Quit

### 3. Results Panel (Bottom Right)

View query results in three ways:

#### Table View

- Scrollable data table with column headers
- Shows all rows and columns from query results
- Automatically updates when you run a query

#### Chart View

Interactive visualizations with configurable axes:

**Configuration:**
- **X Axis** - Select dimension for x-axis (dropdown of available columns)
- **Y Axis** - Select metric for y-axis (dropdown of available columns)
- **Type** - Choose visualization:
  - **Bar** - Vertical bar chart
  - **Line** - Line plot
  - **Scatter** - Scatter plot

The chart auto-updates when you change configuration or run a new query.

#### SQL View

See the compiled SQL that Sidemantic generates:

- Shows final SQL sent to database
- Displays CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for model queries
- Reveals automatic joins between models
- Syntax highlighted and read-only

This helps you:
- Understand how Sidemantic translates your queries
- Debug query issues
- Learn SQL optimization patterns
- Verify join logic

## Writing Queries

The workbench supports the full Sidemantic SQL syntax:

### Basic Query

```sql
SELECT
  orders.total_revenue,
  orders.order_count,
  customers.region
FROM orders
```

### With Filters

```sql
SELECT
  orders.total_revenue,
  customers.region
FROM orders
WHERE customers.region = 'North'
  AND orders.status = 'completed'
```

### Timeseries with Grouping

```sql
SELECT
  orders.created_month,
  customers.region,
  orders.total_revenue,
  orders.order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY orders.created_month, customers.region
ORDER BY orders.created_month DESC
```

### Cross-Model Queries

Sidemantic automatically joins models based on relationships:

```sql
-- Automatically joins orders → customers → products
SELECT
  products.category,
  customers.region,
  orders.total_revenue
FROM orders
```

### Aggregation

Metrics are automatically aggregated correctly:

```sql
-- Metrics aggregated at region level
SELECT
  customers.region,
  orders.total_revenue,  -- SUM(amount)
  orders.avg_order_value -- AVG(amount)
FROM orders
GROUP BY customers.region
```

## Demo Mode

Demo mode provides a pre-configured semantic layer with sample e-commerce data:

```bash
sidemantic workbench --demo
```

**Includes:**
- 3 models: orders, customers, products
- Sample metrics: revenue, order_count, avg_order_value
- Dimensions: region, status, category, created_month
- Relationships: orders → customers, orders → products
- 365 days of synthetic order data

Perfect for:
- Learning Sidemantic syntax
- Testing queries
- Exploring features
- Demos and presentations

## Tips & Tricks

### Keyboard Navigation

- `Tab` - Move between UI elements
- `Ctrl+R` - Run current query
- `Ctrl+C` - Exit workbench
- Arrow keys - Navigate tables and charts

### Sidebar Resizing

Drag the right edge of the sidebar to resize:
- Default: 38 columns
- Range: 20-100 columns
- Persists during session

### Query Development Workflow

1. **Explore** - Browse models in sidebar to find dimensions/metrics
2. **Write** - Draft query in Custom tab
3. **Run** - Execute with `Ctrl+R`
4. **View Table** - Check results in Table view
5. **View SQL** - Examine generated SQL
6. **Visualize** - Create chart with Chart view
7. **Refine** - Iterate on query

### Chart Best Practices

- Use time dimensions (day, month, year) for x-axis on line charts
- Use categorical dimensions (region, status) for x-axis on bar charts
- Select numeric metrics for y-axis
- Switch between chart types to find best visualization

### Troubleshooting

**No results showing:**
- Check that query is valid SQL
- Verify model/column names match your semantic layer
- Look for errors in footer status bar

**Chart not displaying:**
- Ensure x and y axes are selected
- Check that y-axis is numeric
- Try different chart type

**SQL looks wrong:**
- Compare with expected joins
- Check relationship definitions in models
- Verify foreign key mappings

## Next Steps

- [CLI](cli.qmd) - Other CLI commands
- [Models](models.qmd) - Define your own models
- [Metrics](metrics.qmd) - Create custom metrics
